But if ADB has not been enabled by the time the app starts after boot, the app will no more try to connect to ADB unless explicitly done by opening the app.</p> <p>There's a solution. If you enable ADB on boot in an automated way, you can notify the app by sending the following <code>Intent</code> that ADB has been enabled:</p> <pre><code>am startservice -a PKG_NAME.action.ADB_CONNECT -d adb://:5555\n</code></pre> <p>where PKG_NAME is the package name of the app and <code>5555</code> is the ADB port.
